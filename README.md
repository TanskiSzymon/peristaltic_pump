# Peristaltic pump

## Basics

Peristalsis is a type of smooth muscle movement that occurs in various parts of the digestive tract and other systems.  
It is characterized by rhythmic, wave-like muscle contractions that move the contents through the tract.

## About project

This project is part of a larger initiative â€“ the food printer. More details can be found here:  
ðŸ‘‰ [Food Printer](https://github.com/TanskiSzymon/food-printer)

The main goal was to design a peristaltic pump powered by an NEMA17 stepper motor. The pump was designed to be easy to mount on standard 30x30 aluminum profiles and use food-safe materials. A certified food-grade hose was selected, and all components are affordable, widely available, and easy to 3D print using a standard printer.

## Version 3.0 â€“ **New Improved Design**

This is an upgraded version of the peristaltic pump based on feedback and improvements from version 2.0.

**What's new in version 3.0:**
- Improved construction for better performance and reliability.
- Designed for a larger hose diameter â€“ increased flow capacity.
- Enhanced internal geometry to further reduce pulsation and ensure smoother operation.

**Required components (besides 3D-printed parts):**
- 4Ã— M3x30 screws  
- NEMA17 stepper motor (shaft length **min. 23 mm**)  
- 6Ã— bearings **686zz** (or equivalents: height 5 mm, inner Ã˜ 6 mm, outer Ã˜ 13 mm)  
- Flexible hose with **outer diameter 6 mm** and **inner diameter 4 mm**

All 3D printed parts in my build were printed with **PLA**, but **PETG, ABS or ASA** can also be used depending on your needs.

## Version 2.0

In the second version of the pump, the hose diameter was reduced, and a second offset stage was added, shifted by 60%.  
This ensures that when the lower stage is in the pressure-building phase, the upper stage is in the opposite phase, providing a smoother flow.
