# Peristaltic pump


# Basics
Peristalsis is a type of smooth muscle movement that occurs in various parts of the digestive tract and other systems. 
It is characterized by rhythmic, wave-like muscle contractions that move the contents through the tract.

# About project

This project is part of a larger initiative – the food printer. More details can be found here: Food Printer [https://github.com/TanskiSzymon/food-printer]

The main goal was to design a peristaltic pump powered by an NEMA17 stepper motor. The pump was designed to be easy to mount on standard 30x30 aluminum profiles and use food-safe materials. A certified food-grade hose was selected, and all components are affordable, widely available, and easy to 3D print using a standard printer.


# Version 2.0
In the second version of the pump, the hose diameter was reduced, and a second offset stage was added, shifted by 60%. 
This ensures that when the lower stage is in the pressure-building phase, the upper stage is in the opposite phase, providing a smoother flow.
